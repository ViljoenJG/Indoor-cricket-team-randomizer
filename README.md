# Randomize Indoor Cricket Team

I Manage an Indoor Cricket team and we wanted to mix up the fielding positions and batting order a bit. I created this little script to take care of it.

## Getting started

1. You need to have `NodeJS` installed.
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `npm i` from the terminal in the project directory
4. Enter names of the team in the `team.txt` file. One name per line.
5. Run `npm start` from the terminal.

You should see the batting order and fielding positions logged out to the console.
